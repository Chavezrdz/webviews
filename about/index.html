<p class="page_intro">WebViews is written and maintained by Dave McNally and Ben Briggs. Our plan was to develop and publish a completely open-source project covering all aspects of the web industry. With that in mind, you can <a href="https://github.com/WebViews/webviews" title="WebViews on GitHub">view the source</a> on GitHub where you’re welcome to fork the project and use as you please!</p>

<p class="page_copy">I’m a freelance designer &amp; front-end developer with a passion for subtle details and mobile. A recent WordPress-to-Jekyll convert and terminal fan, I’m most at home with Photoshop, Sublime Text, iTerm and some hot coffee.</p>

<p class="page_copy">I write all of the Gulp plugins and play all of the card gaimz. I’ll also write my own bio shortly. When I’ve finished playing the gaim that is. So many decks to play and so little time. Also, all the commits.</p>
