Paragraphs such as this are the most common and standard post content type. Most of what is written is likely to be the humble paragraph, mixed in with code blocks, images and the occassional list. The aim of this post is to account for these various elements in a global format so moving forward we can just publish our [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and know what it’s going to look like.

## Here’s a H2 as the first subheading

> This is one of those fancy blockquotes, saying something clever that people will no doubt enjoy and then tell all of their friends. Or not. You know, because nobody is going to be reading this anyway and if they did, they wouldn’t have a clue who the author is so it can’t possibly be tweet-worthy.

```
{% raw %}
<div class="wrap_small">

    <article>
        <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
        {{ content }}
    </article>

</div><!-- //wrap_small -->
{% endraw %}
```

### And along comes a H3

So that covers blockquotes, code blocks and links. At the moment, we’re having Jekyll handle our code blocks. It wraps code elements in pre elements and then a highlight class div. To show Liquid within our code, we use the `{% raw %}{% raw %}{% endraw %}` tag which stops Jekyll from parsing any Liquid in our examples. Inline code such as in the previous sentence is wrapped only in a code element so we can use that to our advantage in styling inline code vs blocks of code.

* Here’s an unordered list item.
* Second items usually follow the first.
* A third list item sits here.
* Lastly, a fourth item for you.

#### Some H4 goodness for your eyeballs

##### This is a H5 you know

Got our unordered lists in order. Using the `:before` pseudo-selector, we set a custom content value to allow for a larger square marker with a custom colour, without any extra markup. This way, we just write standard lists and the styles are taken care of. No more extra spans!

###### The last of the headers

1. The first in a list.
2. Number two from me to you.
3. Item three is a gift from me.
4. And number four, there are no more.

Ordered lists have been taken care of too. Hacked together with `content: counter();` to allow custom number styles without extra elements in markup. Again, not the most ideal solution but it works fine for our case and being able to write classless posts is the main thing.
